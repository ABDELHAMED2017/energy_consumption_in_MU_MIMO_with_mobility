energy_consumption_in_MU_MIMO_with_mobility
===========================================

This code computes the energy consumption in the downlink of a single-cell multi-user MIMO system in which the base station (BS) makes use of N antennas to communicate with K single-antenna user equipments (UEs). The UEs move around in the cell according to a random walk mobility model.
